LOFT-Q is the second series prototyping board of Mixtle Project. Based on Allwinner A31 soc, This board is well designed for embedded developers and engineers, makers and geekers, which could be used as Home Media Center, personal cloud platform, NAS, etc.



Open Hardware
-------------

LOFT-Q is released as an open hardware project, all the resource will be open to all people focused on it, including source code, hardware designing, documents, tools. For now, we have opened some software resources as below:

* Uboot
* Linux kernel
* buildroot
* documentation
* misc tools

For the Allwinner socs, there is one open community that provides support for its earlier socs. Some of the resources will still work for the later socs, including A31 soc. More info, please refer to the site of Linux-sunxi community: http://linux-sunxi.org.

The Hardware resource is still under working, and will be released soon.
